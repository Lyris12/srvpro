Congratulations! You just found Lyris' GitHub website-- which by the way, doubles as a KoishiPRO server!... Which is currently unfinished.
<br>
<br>KoishiPRO is a fork of the YGOPRO automatic Yu-Gi-Oh! dueling simulator client, which can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/purerosefallen/ygopro/releases/">https://github.com/purerosefallen/ygopro/releases/</a>.
